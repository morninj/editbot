# General:

# TODO en dash instead of hyphen between numerals

# TODO don't superscript ordinals

# TODO hunt and destroy two consecutive spaces

# Bluebook (and other legal writing):

# TODO make sure "available at" is italicized

# TODO don't italicize comma after `See, e.g.,`
# /See, e.g.[ITAL],[/ITAL]/

# TODO detect "statue" (because the author probably meant "statute")
